# Community project instructions  

After completing these first assignments,
- 3.20.Design a Class for your Community (Doc)
- 3.20.Design a Class for your Community (Runestone)
you will create a working version here by following these steps:
1. Rename the `CommunityProject.java` file with the same name as your community class name. For example, if your class name is `CommunityGarden`, your renamed Java file name would be `CommunityGarden.java`.
2. Copy the code from your Runstone activity Subsection 3.20.1: Code your Class, not including the main method (`public static void main(String[] args){}`), into your Java file
3. Copy the code from the main method into the `Main.java` file
4. Run and debug your program until it works as expected.
5. Submit your project for review.
