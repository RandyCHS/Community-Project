# Community project instructions  

1. Create a new java file with the same name as your community class name. For example, if your class name is `CommunityGarden`, your new Java file name would be `CommunityGarden.java`.
2. Copy the code from your Runstone activity 5.6.3. If you completed activities 5.1.6, 5.2.2, 5.4.3. 5.5.2, and 5.6.3, you have a complete class in 5.6.3.
3. Paste your complete class from 5.6.3 into your Java class file you created in step 1.
4. Submit your project for review.

A completed class CommunityGarden can be viewed as an example. You'll need to submit your project before you can view the example solution in Canvas
