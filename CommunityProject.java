public class CommunityProject {
    // 1. write 3 instance variables for class: private type variableName;

    // 2. Add a constructor with 3 parameters to set all of the instance variables to the given parameters.

    // 3. Write a print() method that uses System.out.println to print out all the instance variables.

    // 4. Create accessor (get) methods for each of the instance variables.

    // 5. Create mutator (set) methods for each of the instance variables.

    // 6. Create a toString() method that returns all the information in the instance variables.

    // 7. Write an additional method for your class that takes a parameter. For example, there could be a print method with arguments that indicate how you want to print out the information, e.g. print(format) could print the data according to an argument that is "plain" or "table" where the data is printed in a table drawn with dashes (-) and lines (|).

    // 8. Write a main method that constructs at least 2 objects of your class using the constructor and then calls all of the methods that you created above to test them.
